# Project Structure Explanation

Use this command to display the directory structure.

```sh
tree `pwd` -a --dirsfirst -I "node_modules|.git"
```

The layout provided is indicative of a typical [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) project, which is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. Below is an explanation of its structure in Markdown format:

## Source Directory (`src`)

The `src` folder is where all application source code resides.

- **`config`**
  - Contains configuration settings for the application.
  - `index.ts`: Aggregates and exports the configuration.

- **`modules`**
  - Holds the modular divisions of the application functionality.

  - **`auth`**
    - Contains authentication logic.
    - `auth.module.ts`: NestJS module file for authentication.
    - `auth.resolver.ts`: Handles GraphQL queries and mutations for authentication, if GraphQL is used.
    - `auth.service.ts`: Contains business logic for authentication.

  - **`user`**
    - Handles user-related functionality.
    - `dto`: Data Transfer Objects for transferring data over the network.
      - `new-user.input.ts`: Defines data for creating a new user.
      - `update-user.input.ts`: Defines data for updating user information.
      - `user.type.ts`: Defines the user type for GraphQL, if used.
    - `models`: Contains the database model/entity definition.
      - `user.entity.ts`: Defines the user entity corresponding to the database.
    - `user.module.ts`: NestJS module file for user functionality.
    - `user.resolver.ts`: GraphQL resolver logic for user operations.
    - `user.service.ts`: Business logic related to user operations.

- **Application Files**
  - `app.controller.spec.ts`: Unit tests for the application controller.
  - `app.controller.ts`: Handles incoming requests and sends responses.
  - `app.module.ts`: The root module file that combines various modules.
  - `app.service.ts`: Provides application-level services.
  - `main.ts`: The entry point for the application that boots up the NestJS app.

## Test Directory (`test`)

Contains end-to-end tests.

- `app.e2e-spec.ts`: End-to-end test specifications.
- `jest-e2e.json`: Jest configuration for e2e testing.

## Configuration and Miscellaneous Files

- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code style and quality checks.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies untracked files for Git.
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration for code formatting.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `nest-cli.json`: Configuration for the NestJS CLI.
- `package-lock.json`: Locks npm package versions for consistent installs.
- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.build.json`: TypeScript build configuration for production.
- `tsconfig.json`: Root TypeScript configuration file.
- `yarn.lock`: Yarn package manager lock file for dependency version locking.

This structure is common in NestJS projects, highlighting modular architecture and its integration with TypeScript and modern tooling.
